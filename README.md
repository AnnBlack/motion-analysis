This project is a part of a selective course "Motion Analysis" at HAW Hamburg, WS2022-2023.

The Notebook is created based on the existing Human Activity Recognition database [Link text Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones). The idea of the project is to find an optimal ML algorithm to recognize two types of movements - downstairs walk and walking upstairs.
